A Python program generates the fragments of a lover’s discourse: it rearranges the lyrics of English love songs. The permutations are way too fast, and the semantics of the English language (the now universal language of love) bleaches completely. Just like those random — and yet surprisingly predictable — sentences, the image of a loved one is constructed from clothes, which used to belong to different people. Only a random mark on a T-shirt gets one back to the event, which the language fails to encompass.
