A python program generates the fragments of a lover’s discourse: it rearranges the lyrics of English love songs. The permutations are way too fast, and the semantics of the English language — the now universal language of love — bleaches completely. Just like those random — yet surprisingly predictable — sentences, the image of a loved one is constructed from clothes, which used to belong to different people. Only a random mark on a T-shirt, or a pair of jeans gets one back to the event — an encounter — which the language fails to encompass.
