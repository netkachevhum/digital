**overcoming reading: a series of digital literature workshops**

In this series of workshops about digital literature, I explored the emancipation of reading, or the liberation of the process of reading from the diktat of the author and conservative literary discourses.

Participants got to know the history of digital literature and the theory that highlights its critical potential. During the workshops they will learn to work with interactive literature, kinetic poetry, and poetry that is automatically transformed into sound. 

**1/3: cybertext, or the emancipation of classical Russian literature**
During the lecture part of the workshop, I talked about hypertext literature and its connection to feminist literature. The presence of links removes the author’s control over the process of reading. The way readers read the text depends on them. Readers have equal rights to writers and there are no “correct” or “incorrect” trajectories of reading. Interactive literature is an ideal place to hear the voices of subalterns who have previously been silenced by mainstream literary traditions.

During the practical part of the workshop, participants learned to use one of the tools for working with hypertext, the online editor Twine. They used it to deconstruct a number of texts from classical Russian literature, which, according to the philosopher Valery Podoroga, embodies the Russian imperial myth in its form. My goal was to demonstrate that hypertext can sabotage established procedures for reading and writing, destroying the linearity of reading and the illusion of the passive presence of the reader in realistic prose.

POETRY IN MOTION: LIVING THROUGH TIME
**poetry in motion: living through time**
The lecture part of the workshop comprises a short introduction to the history of kinetic visual poetry, or poetry in motion: from subtitles in silent movies to the poetic film experiments of the 1970s. On the one hand, visual poetry suggests that the visual image has priority, something that is deliberately disembodied, objectified, and places the viewer in a privileged position. On the other hand, video suggests duration, and in this sense text in motion does not cancel time like printed text but relates to the subjective time of the viewer. In this sense, kinetic poetry is closer to the body than ordinary text and can suggest new trajectories for the critique of the imperial.

During the practical part of the workshop, participants will create a kinetic poem from scratch using p5js, a popular environment for creative coding. No programming skills are required. Together with the artist, participants will try to deconstruct the Russian literary canon and add visual and temporal dimensions to text, roughly speaking crossing Tolstoy’s novel with Stephane Mallarmé’s “A Throw of the Dice.”




**interface: some critical strategies**

 In this talk, I sketch out three artistic strategies that discover the hidden logics of interfaces and help deconustruct and criticize them. Following Alexander Galloway, I conceptualize digital interfaces as a frame that pretends to be a window. Interfaces manipulate users and define user experience altogether, yet they hide their presence; in this way, interfaces have very much in common with ideology, as Wendy Chun has shown.

**passport to the shredder, or on the other side of bureaucracy**

_a workshop on generative poetry at [Garage Digital](https://garage.digital/en/a-workshop-on-generative-poetry-by-ivan-netkachev) (in Russian)_\

In this workshop about generative poetry, I look at the role of violence in the language of bureaucracy. In the lecture part, I discuss generative poetry in the history of art and literature (see the slides). Then I suggest that participants work with a poetic text using the code of simple poetic algorithms in Python (see the Google Colab notebook).
