**Passport to the shredder, or on the other side of bureaucracy** 
2022\
_a workshop on generative poetry at [Garage Digital](https://garage.digital/en/a-workshop-on-generative-poetry-by-ivan-netkachev) (in Russian)_

In this workshop about generative poetry, I look at the role of violence in the language of bureaucracy. In the lecture part, I discuss generative poetry in the history of art and literature (see the slides). Then I suggest that participants work with a poetic text using the code of simple poetic algorithms in Python (see the Google Colab notebook).\

**The interface: some critical strategies** 
2023\
_a lecutre at the digital humanities master's program at [ITMO](https://en.itmo.ru/) (in Russian)_

Following Alexander Galloway, I conceptualize digital interfaces as a frame that pretends to be a window. Inrefaces manipulate users and define user experience altogether, yet they hide their presence; in this way, interfaces have very much in common with ideology, as Wendy Chun has shown. In this talk, I sketch out three artistic strategies that discover the hidden logics of interfaces and help deconustruct and criticize them.\
