**interinterface: why affective interfaces are spatial machinery how they normalize and discipline queer identities**
\
2024, with Roman Solodkov\
_published by the Institute of Network Cultures_\
[full text](https://networkcultures.org/blog/2024/02/08/interinterface/)\
A short essay on how dating apps constrain and discipline the identities of their users. We conceptualize the interfaces of dating apps as a spatial machinery manipulating users' flows of time, and, thus, homogenizing their subjectivities.

I show that AI is far from being objective, but is biased in many particular ways. Algorithms only benefit the vectorialist class, as McKenzie Wark would put it; according to Dan McQuillan, they even contribute to the fascization of the Western world. After that, I discuss some activist strategies of resitance to AI, claiming that AI should be totally transparent at any level, and that people's councils should be responsible for the regulation of its work.

[full text in Russian](https://syg.ma/@ivannetk/intierfieis-miezhdu-ia-i-ty-where-i-end-and-you-begin)

A series of short autofictional and theoretical texts around the interface as a concept and as a metaphor, inspired by Alexander Galloway's writings: skin as a body-to-body interface, vague body borders and the language of imperialist Russian classics as a corrupt interface.

**home delivery war, lake of fire, and one clothing for all. how contemporary artists conceptualize militarism**

_published on knife.media_\
[full text in Russian](https://knife.media/art-and-war/)

This text was written as an initial response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. My goal was to discuss the existing artistic strategies to represent and, unltimately, dismantle and delegitimize war altogether --- from Thomas Hirschhorn and Krzysztof Wodiczko to Harun Farocki and Valid Raad. 

**what is bureaucratic language, and how to unlearn it**
\
2021\
_published on knife.media_\
[full text in Russian](https://knife.media/bureaucracy-language/)

Following David Graeber, I suggest that bureaucratic language is essentially the language of violence, or a dead language. Then I discuss the artistic strategies aiming at liberating the imaginanation from the nonsense bureaucratic structures: Charles Reznikoff's poetic reappropriation of judical language, Kenneth Goldsmith's _uncreative writing_ and situationists' _détournement_.

An extensive guide to generative poetry: from OULIPO's combinatorial expetiments with poetic language to Twitter bots writing haiku.  

**what is poetic language, and how it relates to everyday speech**
\
2020\
_published on knife.media_\
[full text in Russian](https://knife.media/poetic-language/)

A discussion of grammatical peculiarities of poetic language from a formal (Chomskian) linguistic perpescitve. It includes the analysis of 18th century English poetry and Sagas of Icelanders put forward by linguists Nigel Fabb and Wayne O'neil. 

**chronicles of digital existence: in-game photography as a new art form**
\
2020\
_published on knife.media_\
[full text in Russian](https://knife.media/game-photo/)

An attempt to conceptualize in-game photography as a medium that is onthologically independent from optical media. Drawing inspiration from Timothy Morton's writing on object oriented onthologies, I suggest that in-game photo is a representation of digital existence characteristic of software and computers altogether --- very much independent of human mode of existence.
