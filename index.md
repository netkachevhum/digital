Ivan Netkachev (b. 1998, Orenburg) is a multimedia artist, publicist, and writer. He has bachelor’s and master’s degrees in theoretical linguistics from the Higher School of Economics and is studying at Rodchenko Art School (Moscow). He works with generative poetry, automatic generation of texts and images, video games, and video. 

He attempts at discovering the hidden politics behind the omnipresent algorithms which structure our society, i.e. the traumas and violence induced by the artificial intelligence. On the other hand, he investigates the emancipatory potential of AI: perhaps one can find the machine's weaknesses, and use it against itself.
