Ivan Netkachev (b. 1998, Orenburg) is a multimedia artist, publicist, and writer. He has bachelor’s and master’s degrees in theoretical linguistics from the Higher School of Economics and has graduated from Rodchenko Art School (Moscow); currently he is a certificate student at The New Centre of Research & Practice. He works with generative poetry, automatic generation of texts and images, video games, and video. 

He attempts at discovering the hidden politics behind the omnipresent algorithms which structure our society, i.e. the traumas and violence induced by the artificial intelligence. On the other hand, he investigates the emancipatory potential of AI: perhaps one can find the machine's weaknesses, and use it against itself.

Currently based in Tbilisi, Georgia. 

_Russian troops should be withdrawn from Ukraine._
